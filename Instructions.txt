Instructions:
------------


1. Start a notebook.

2. Data has been provided in the zip file - you are to do the classification and regression tasks

3. For the classification dataset perform the following tasks:
	
(a) Using sklearn, read the data into a numpy array - or into a form you can use for training your algorithms
	
(b) Using sklearn split the data into a training set of 80% of the training set and 20% for the test set
	
(c) Train an SVM algorithm on the training data and get a score for the accuracy on the test set
	
(d) Use another performance measure in sklearn apart from the accuracy for how your algorithm performs on the test data.
	
(e) Using sklearn run an 10 fold cross validation using all the data and provide the 10 scores for each validation run. Provide also the mean value for 
the 10 validation runs.



4. For the regression dataset perform the following tasks:
	
(a) Using sklearn, read the data into a numpy array - or into a form you can use for training your algorithms
	
(b) Using sklearn split the data into a training set of 80% of the training set and 20% for the test set
	
(c) Train an RandomForest Regression algorithm on the training data and get a score for the error on the test set
	
(d) Use another performance measure in sklearn apart from the accuracy for how your algorithm performs on the test data.
