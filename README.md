# Classification-and-Regression-using-sklearn
In this session, i am going to perform regression task with sklearn. It will involve;  

Reading data into a numpy array - or into a form you can use for training your algorithms 
read the data into a numpy array - or into a form you can use for training your algorithms Using sklearn split the data into a training set of 80% of the training set and 20% for the test set Training an RandomForest Regression algorithm on the training data and get a score for the error on the test set Use another performance measure in sklearn apart from the accuracy for how your algorithm performs on the test data.
